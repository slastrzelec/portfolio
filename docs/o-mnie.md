Hello! 👋  
My name is <strong>Sławomir Strzelec</strong>. I am a scientist transitioning into <strong>data science and machine learning</strong>, with a strong academic and research background in <strong>organic chemistry, nanotechnology, spectroscopy</strong>, and experimental methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
After completing my studies in chemistry and gaining extensive experience in laboratory work, structural analysis, and computational research, I decided to combine my scientific knowledge with modern <strong>data analysis</strong> and <strong>Python-based machine learning</strong> techniques.  
I enjoy solving scientific and technical problems using analytical thinking, programming, and data-driven methods.
</p>

## What I Focus On

- Data processing and analysis in Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, SymPy)  
- Machine learning and predictive modelling (scikit-learn, PyCaret)  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Scientific computing and analytical reasoning  
- Chemoinformatics and chemical structure analysis  

## Skills

- **Programming & Data:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, SymPy, Jupyter Notebook, Git, SQL  
- **Machine Learning:** regression, classification, model validation, feature importance  
- **Analytics:** descriptive statistics, visualization, problem-solving  
- **Chemistry & Materials Science:** organic synthesis, nanotechnology of carbon structures, NMR spectroscopy, spectroscopy methods, scientific literature research (SciFinder, Reaxys)  
- **Laboratory Techniques:** purification, inert-atmosphere techniques, column chromatography, recrystallization  
- **Soft Skills:** teaching, science communication, time management, teamwork, mentoring
